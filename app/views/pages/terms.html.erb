			    <strong>Services.</strong> 
			IncFlow provides a business profile and information sharing service that allows businesses and professionals the ability to quickly and easily share their corporate profile and other information.  By providing IncFlow with your corporate profile and other information, you can (1) create an “IncFlow Profile” which is based on the information you provide about your business and (2) share your profile information with customers and other businesses, in order to facilitate transactions and information sharing through a web-based interface (the “Services”).  An IncFlow Profile reflects the information provided by that business or their representative, which is intended to facilitate the information sharing and gathering purposes; it is not a guarantee that the information is accurate, complete, reliable or truthful or that the information has been independently checked or verified by IncFlow.
